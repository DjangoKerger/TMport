        <h3>Digital Crafts</h3>
        <h6>Full Stack Developer</h6>
        <p>I kick started my programmer journey by attending Digital Crafts coding bootcamp. In this bootcamp I learned to absorb a 
          ton of code syntax and theory in a short amount of time. This helped me learn that any position I am put in I can pick up the language and 
          work flow quickly.

        <h3>Team Player </h3>
        <h6>working together</h6>
        <p>One of the best things about my programming experience has been the people I have met. I work well in a team and I am able to fill
          any role the team needs wether its leader or follower. I have been on teams my whole life and have accomplished a lot with them.

        <h3>What I am looking for</h3>
        <h6>junior positions</h6>
        <p>I am excited and motivated to contribute to a team and company. The best fit for me would be somewhere there has a positive 
          workplace, questions are allowed and encouraged, and stimulates growth. As proven by my previous work experience I am someone
          who does not hop companies therefore I will be a valuable investment.
